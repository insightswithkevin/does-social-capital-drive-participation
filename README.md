# Social Capital and Political Participation – A Cross-National Analysis

This repository contains a term paper written during my Bachelor's studies. It explores how welfare state characteristics influence the relationship between social capital and political participation, using cross-national data from the European Social Survey (ESS Round 9). Multilevel modeling is used to analyze data from 22 countries.
